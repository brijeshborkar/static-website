                              Nandi Hills or Nandi betta (Anglicised forms include Nandidurg and Nandydoorg) is an ancient hill fortress in southern India,
                               in the Chikkaballapur district of Karnataka state.

                               In traditional belief, the hills are the origin of the Arkavathy river.
                               t gets its name from the ancient Nandi or bull which is meant to be the mount of Lord Shiva. These hills are the source of the rivers Palar,
                                Arkavati and Pennar. It was one of the Tipu's summer retreats. There are about 1,200 steps laid from foot of the hill to reach the top.
                               Bhoga Nandishwara Temple situated at the foot of the hills is a must see place which houses a 1000 year old sculpture of Nandi.
                                <br/>The best time to enjoy the beauty of this scenic place is early mornings. Although you can visit the hills at any time of the year,
                                it is recommended to go during the rainy season
